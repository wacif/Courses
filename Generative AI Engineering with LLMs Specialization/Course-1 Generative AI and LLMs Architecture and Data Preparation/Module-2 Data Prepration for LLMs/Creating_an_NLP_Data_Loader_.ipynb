For natural language processing (NLP) tasks like yours, data often comes in variable lengths due to differing sentence structures and lengths across languages. The data loader efficiently batches these variable-length sequences, ensuring that your models are trained on diverse examples in every iteration. This batching is crucial for harnessing the power of parallel computation on GPUs, thus expediting the training process.\n","\n","Furthermore, the data loader aids in shuffling the data set, which is vital for preventing models from memorizing the sequence of training data and promoting better generalization.
